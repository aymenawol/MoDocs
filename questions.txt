My product's name is MoDocs

MoDocs is an AI-driven platform that automates professional business document creation. It generates invoices, contracts, reports, proposals, and more using templates and user inputs. The system adapts tone and content automatically, provides a guided creation workflow, and lets users preview, edit, and manage documents in real time. It aligns with MoFlo's values of streamlining small to medium business operations by reducing manual paperwork, saving time, and improving consistency across essential documents. 

I chose to create this product because I noticed that existing tools like MoLetters only focus on generating simple letters and don't support the broader range of documents businesses actually need. MoLetters is good for quick, single-purpose letters, but it doesn't handle things like invoices, contracts, proposals, or reports. Seeing that gap is what sparked the idea: businesses don't just need letters, they need an end-to-end document creation system that can generate many types of professional documents, maintain consistent formatting, and produce polished content automatically. MoDocs was built to solve that larger need.

MoFlo's small and medium-sized business clients would be interested in MoDocs because it removes a major time and administrative burden. These businesses often don't have dedicated staff for drafting invoices, contracts, proposals, and other formal documents, so owners or managers end up doing it themselves. MoDocs lets them generate these documents quickly, accurately, and consistently without needing writing expertise. It reduces errors, speeds up operations, and helps them present a more professional image to customers, partners, and vendors.

I would start by integrating real AI. Right now, the app only shows a 3-second delay with generic placeholder text, so I'd connect it to OpenAI or Claude APIs to generate intelligent, customized document content based on user input. I would also build a proper backend since everything currently lives in browser localStorage, documents can be lost if users clear their browser or switch devices. I'd implement a cloud database like Supabase or Firebase with user authentication to ensure documents are permanently saved and accessible anywhere.
